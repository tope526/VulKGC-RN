### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have any suggestion for enhancing any of the modules please send us an enhancement using the issue [template](https://github.com/Sujit-O/pykg2vec/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

### Adding Algorithm
We are continually striving to add the state-of-the-art algorithms in the library. If you want to suggest adding any algorithm or add your algoirithm to the library, please follow the following steps:

* Make sure the generator is able to produce the batches
* Make sure to follow the class structure presented in pykg2vec/core/KGMeta.py


### Adding Evaluation Metric
We are always eager to add more evaluation metrics for link prediction, triple classification, and so on. You may create a new evaluation process in pykg2vec/utils/evaluation.py to add the metric.

### Csource for Python Modules
Although we use Tensorflow for running the main modules, there are many alforithms written in pure python. We invite you to contibute by converting the python source code to more efficient C or C++ codes. 

### Adding Dataset Source
We encourage you to add your own dataset links. Currenlty the pykg2vec/config/global_config.py handles the datasets, how to extract them and generate the training, testing and validation triples.
